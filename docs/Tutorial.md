## Short Example

The nearly-minimal code below will calculate an array of true vertical underground intensities using daemonflux for an array of 28 default slant depths and will plot them against the slant depths.

```python
# Import packages

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import mute.constants as mtc
import mute.underground as mtu

# Set the constants

mtc.set_overburden("flat")
mtc.set_medium("rock")
mtc.set_density(2.65)

# Calculate true vertical intensities for the default slant depths and atmosphere

intensities        = mtu.calc_u_intensities(method = "tr", model = "daemonflux")
intensities_errors = mtu.calc_u_intensities(method = "tr", model = "daemonflux", return_error = True)

# Plot the results

plt.figure(facecolor = "white")
plt.semilogy(mtc.slant_depths, intensities, color = "#b82b3d")
plt.fill_between(mtc.slant_depths, intensities + intensities_errors, intensities - intensities_errors, color = "#b82b3d", lw = 0, alpha = 0.2)
plt.xlabel(r"Slant Depth, $X$ (km.w.e.)")
plt.ylabel(r"True Vertical Intensity, $I^u_{\mathrm{tr}}$ (cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$sr$^{-1}$)")
plt.show()
```

As of [v2.0.0](https://github.com/wjwoodley/mute/releases/tag/2.0.0), MUTE provides calculations for labs under both flat overburdens and mountains.

## Importing All MUTE Modules

The MUTE constants and functions are split between four modules. They can be imported as follows:

```python
import mute.constants as mtc
import mute.surface as mts
import mute.propagation as mtp
import mute.underground as mtu
```

When MUTE is imported for the first time, the data files supplied with the GitHub release will be downloaded to the directory MUTE is installed to. These data files help speed up MUTE calculations significantly as they contain many pre-computed surface flux matrices and survival probability tensors.

## Changing the Constants

The globally-set constants are stored in the ``constants`` module, and are set using setter functions. The following piece of code sets all of the constants to their default values.

```python
mtc.set_verbose(2)
mtc.set_output(True)
# mtc.set_directory("mute/data")
mtc.set_lab("Default")
mtc.set_overburden("flat")
mtc.set_vertical_depth(0.5)
mtc.set_medium("rock")
mtc.set_reference_density(2.65)
mtc.set_n_muon(1000000)
```

The docstrings in the source code for each function describe what values they can take.

It is usually best to leave the directory as the default value. Data files downloaded automatically from GitHub will be stored where MUTE is installed (the location of this directory can be found by running ``pip show mute``), as will output data files created while using MUTE. The directory can be changed for ease of use on a computing cluster (see the example in [``/examples/cluster``](../examples/cluster) or the example in [Using MUTE on a Computer Cluster](Tutorial_Cluster.md)).

### Loading Mountain Profiles

To define the profile of a moutain, the ``mtc.load_mountain()`` function is used. In order to use this, the overburden type must be set to a mountain with ``mtc.set_overburden("mountain")``. Calling it like this will use the defaults for all of the optional keyword arguments:

```python
mtc.load_mountain(file_name, file_units = "kmwe", rock_density = None, scale = 1, max_slant_depth = 14)
```

The file name, indicating the full (relative or absolute) path of the file that contains the information for the mountain profile must be provided. The file should have three columns:

1. Zenith angle in degrees
2. Azimuthal angle in degrees
3. Slant depth in m, m.w.e., km, or km.w.e.

For an example see, [``/examples/example_mountain_calculations.ipynb``](../examples/example_mountain_calculations.ipynb).

``file_units`` refers to the units of the slant depths given in the file. The units can be either ``"m"``, ``"mwe"``, ``"km"``, or ``"kmwe"``. MUTE will convert the slant depths to km.w.e. if they are not already in km.w.e. ``rock_density`` refers to the density of rock used to define the slant depths in the file. ``scale`` can be used to scale all slant depths in the file by a multiplicative factor (useful for computing uncertainties arising from rock densities). ``max_slant_depth`` defines the maximum slant depth that will be considered in the calculations; any depths in the file that are above this value will be changed to 0 and ignored.

For more information on modelling mountain overburdens for specific laboratories with MUTE, see [Modelling Labs](Tutorial_Labs.md).

## Units

The following are the default units used throughout MUTE:

* **Energies:** MeV
* **Angles:** Degrees
* **Depths:** km.w.e.
* **Survival Probabilities:** $(\mathrm{MeV}^2\Â \mathrm{km.w.e.})^{-1}$
* **Fluxes (Flat):** $(\mathrm{cm}^2\ \mathrm{s}\ \mathrm{sr}\ \mathrm{MeV})^{-1}$
* **Fluxes (Mountains):** $(\mathrm{cm}^2\ \mathrm{s}\ \mathrm{sr}\ \mathrm{MeV}^2){^-1}$
* **Intensities (Flat):** $(\mathrm{cm}^2\ \mathrm{s}\ \mathrm{sr})^{-1}$
* **Intensities (Mountains):** $(\mathrm{cm}^2\ \mathrm{s}\ \mathrm{sr}\ \mathrm{km.w.e.})^{-1}$
* **Energy Spectra:** $(\mathrm{cm}^2\ \mathrm{s}\ \mathrm{MeV})^{-1}$
* **Angular Distributions (Theta):** $(\mathrm{cm}^2\ \mathrm{s})^{-1}$
* **Angular Distributions (Phi):** $(\mathrm{cm}^2\ \mathrm{s}\ \mathrm{rad})^{-1}$
* **Total Fluxes:** $(\mathrm{cm}^2\ \mathrm{s})^{-1}$
* **Densities:** $\mathrm{g}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$

## Slant Depths and Angles

**NOTE:** The slant depths and angles in MUTE should not be changed directly. If custom values are needed, the ``depths`` and ``angles`` arguments in the ``mtu.calc_u_intensities()`` and ``mtu.calc_u_tot_flux()`` functions can be used. If these are not sufficient, the final results can be interpolated to custom depths and angles. MUTE will raise an exception if any of ``mtc.ENERGIES``, ``mtc._SLANT_DEPTHS``, ``mtc._ANGLES``, ``mtc.ANGLES_FOR_S_FLUXES``, ``mtc.slant_depths``, or ``mtc.angles`` are changed.

The default slant depths and zenith angles are given by the following constants:

* **``mtc._SLANT_DEPTHS``:** An array of 28 default slant depths between 0.5 km.w.e. and 14 km.w.e., going up in steps of 0.5 km.w.e., defined by ``np.linspace(0.5, 14, 28)``.
```
array([ 0.5,  1. ,  1.5,  2. ,  2.5,  3. ,  3.5,  4. ,  4.5,  5. ,  5.5,
        6. ,  6.5,  7. ,  7.5,  8. ,  8.5,  9. ,  9.5, 10. , 10.5, 11. ,
       11.5, 12. , 12.5, 13. , 13.5, 14. ])
```
* **``mtc._ANGLES``:** An array of 28 default zenith angles corresponding to the default slant depths.
```
array([ 0.        , 60.        , 70.52877937, 75.52248781, 78.46304097,
       80.40593177, 81.7867893 , 82.81924422, 83.62062979, 84.26082952,
       84.78409143, 85.21980815, 85.58827421, 85.90395624, 86.17744627,
       86.4166783 , 86.62771332, 86.81526146, 86.98303869, 87.13401602,
       87.27059736, 87.39474873, 87.50809363, 87.61198454, 87.70755722,
       87.7957725 , 87.87744864, 87.9532869 ])
```
* **``mtc.ANGLES_FOR_S_FLUXES``:** An array of 20 default equally-spaced zenith angles between 0 degrees and 90 degrees for use in calculating the surface fluxes.
```
array([ 0.        ,  4.73684211,  9.47368421, 14.21052632, 18.94736842,
       23.68421053, 28.42105263, 33.15789474, 37.89473684, 42.63157895,
       47.36842105, 52.10526316, 56.84210526, 61.57894737, 66.31578947,
       71.05263158, 75.78947368, 80.52631579, 85.26315789, 90.        ])
```

All calculations of surface flux matrices, survival probability tensors, and undeground flux matrices and tensors are done using these default values. For calculations after these basic steps, like those for underground intensities, interpolations are done to the values in ``mtc.slant_depths`` and ``mtc.angles`` (which have default values ``mtc._SLANT_DEPTHS`` and ``mtc._ANGLES`` respectively, but change when ``mtc.set_vertical_depth()`` is used to the set the vertical depth) for flat overburdens, and ``mtc.mountain.slant_depths``, ``mtc.mountain.zenith``, and ``mtc.mountain.azimuthal`` for mountain overburdens. This is further explained below.

### Flat Overburdens

For a flat overburden, when the vertical depth, $h$, is set, the values of ``mtc.slant_depths`` and ``mtc.angles`` change according to:

$$h = X\cos(\theta),$$

where $X$ is the slant depth, and $\theta$ is the zenith angle. For a lab 3.1 km.w.e. underground (or underwater), the vertical depth can be set with ``mtc.set_vertical_depth(3.1)``. Then, printing ``mtc.slant_depths`` gives:

```
array([ 3.1,  3.5,  4. ,  4.5,  5. ,  5.5,  6. ,  6.5,  7. ,  7.5,  8. ,
        8.5,  9. ,  9.5, 10. , 10.5, 11. , 11.5, 12. , 12.5, 13. , 13.5,
       14. ])
```

The angles in ``mtc.angles`` are set according to these depths as well:

$$\theta=\arccos\left(\frac{h}{X}\right),$$

where $h$ is 3.1 km.w.e., and $X$ are the slant depths just above. The angles come out to:

```
array([ 0.        , 27.6604499 , 39.19496743, 46.45778097, 51.68386553,
       55.69234854, 58.89107749, 61.5153646 , 63.71367932, 65.58559769,
       67.20096873, 68.61051667, 69.85211371, 70.95468924, 71.94076951,
       72.82818485, 73.6312505 , 74.3616036 , 75.028809  , 75.64080601,
       76.2042431 , 76.72473252, 77.20704627])
```

[PROPOSAL](https://github.com/tudo-astroparticlephysics/PROPOSAL) is optimised for propagating leptons through long ranges of matter. Due to this limitation of propagating muons short distances, the minimum vertical depth in MUTE is set to 0.5 km.w.e. It is possible to set vertical depths below this, using ``mtc.shallow_extrapolation``:

```python
mtc.shallow_extrapolation = True
mtc.set_vertical_depth(0.1)
```

However, this is not recommended. Results that depend on extrapolation up to shallow depths are not guaranteed to be stable or correct.

### Mountains

``mtc.slant_depths`` and ``mtc.angles`` are not used for mountain overburdens. Instead, after loading the mountain profile (see [above](#loading-mountain-profiles)), MUTE makes available three new global constants in the form of a named tuple that are used to access the angles and slant depths from the mountain profile. They are:

* **``mtc.mountain.zenith``:** An array of unique and sorted zenith angles from the file, in degrees.
* **``mtc.mountain.azimuthal``:** An array of unique and sorted azimuthal angles from the file, in degrees.
* **``mtc.mountain.slant_depths``:** A matrix of unique and sorted slant depths from the file, in km.w.e.

Note that these are immutable objects. They can only be changed by changing the contents of the profile file and then reloading it through the ``mtc.load_mountain()`` function.

## Calculating Underground Intensities

Underground intensities can be calculated using the function ``mtu.calc_u_intensities()``. This function takes many optional keyword arguments.

There are four methods available:

* **``"sd"``:** Single-differential underground intensities (see [below](#single-differential-underground-intensities)).
* **``"eq"``:** Vertical-equivalent underground intensities (see [below](#vertical-equivalent-underground-intensities)).
* **``"tr"``:** True vertical underground intensities (see [below](#true-vertical-underground-intensities)).
* **``"dd"``:** Double-differential underground intensities (see [below](#double-differential-underground-intensities)).

The first three are for flat overburdens (default: ``"sd"``), and the last one is for mountain overburdens (default: ``"dd"``).

### Single-Differential Underground Intensities

Single-differential underground intensities are those defined by the following equation:

$$I^u(\theta)=\int_{E_{\mathrm{th}}}^{\infty}\mathrm{d}E^u\Phi^u(E^u, \theta),$$

where $I^u(\theta)$ is the underground intensity, $E_{\mathrm{th}}$ is an energy threshold, $E^u$ is the underground energy, and $\Phi^u(E^u, \theta)$ is the underground flux.

#### Calling the Function

Running the line below will use the defaults for all of the arguments:

```python
mtu.calc_u_intensities(method = "sd", output = None, file_name = "", force = False, u_fluxes = None, s_fluxes = None, survival_probability_tensor = None, angles = mtc.angles, E_th = 0, model = "mceq", return_error = False, primary_model = "gsf", interaction_model = "sibyll23c", atmosphere = "corsika", location = "USStd", month = None)
```

This returns a one-dimensional array of length ``len(angles)``. The underground intensities in the array will have units of $(\mathrm{cm}^2\ \mathrm{s}\ \mathrm{sr})^{-1}$.

The value for ``output`` will be taken from ``mtc.get_output()``, and the value for ``file_name`` will be constructed based on the values of ``mtc.get_lab()`` and ``method``.

If the surface flux or survival probability matrices that are required to calculate the underground fluxes are not found, MUTE will ask if they should be created. To skip this prompt and force them to be created if they are needed, set ``force`` to ``True``. No matter what ``force`` is set to, if a matrix is output to a file, it will always overwrite any existing file with the same name.

#### Keyword Arguments

The possible keyword arguments and their default values are:

* **``u_fluxes``:** An underground flux tensor of shape ``(28, 91, 20)`` (corresponding to the lengths of (``mtc._SLANT_DEPTHS``, ``mtc.ENERGIES``, ``mtc.ANGLES_FOR_S_FLUXES``)). If none is given, one is calculated using the given ``s_fluxes`` matrix and / or ``survival_probability tensor``, or the set or default models and global propagation constants.
* **``s_fluxes``:** A surface flux matrix of shape ``(91, 20)``. If none is given, one is loaded using the set or default arguments for the models.
* **``survival_probability_tensor``:** A survival probability tensor of shape ``(91, 28, 91)``. If none is given, one is loaded using the set or default global propagation constants.
* **``angles``:** An array of zenith angles in degrees to calculate the underground intensities for. If none is given, ``mtc.angles`` is used.
* **``depths``:** An array of slant depths in km.w.e. to calculate the true vertical underground intensities for. If none is given, ``mtc.slant_depths`` is used.
* **``E_th``:** An energy threshold in MeV to act as the lower bound of the integration of the underground fluxes. If none is given, 0 MeV is used as the lower bound.
* **``model``:** The surface flux model to use ([daemonflux](https://github.com/mceq-project/daemonflux) or [MCEq](https://github.com/afedynitch/MCEq)) if surface fluxes are to be calculated or loaded (as opposed to provided by the ``s_fluxes`` parameter or implicitly included in the ``u_fluxes`` parameter). The default is ``"mceq"``. This parameter is case-insensitive.
* **``return_error``:** If ``True``, the surface flux errors will be returned rather than the surface fluxes. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with ``model = "daemonflux"``. The default is ``False``.
* **``primary_model``:** The primary flux model to use in MCEq. See the options in [``Tutorial_Models``](Tutorial_Models.md#Primary-Model). If none is given, ``"gsf"`` is used. This parameter is case-insensitive.
* **``interaction_model``:** The hadronic interaction model to use in MCEq. See the options in [``Tutorial_Models``](Tutorial_Models.md#Interaction-Model). If none is given, ``"sibyll23c"`` is used. This parameter is case-insensitive.
* **``atmosphere``:** The atmospheric model. See the options in [``Tutorial_Models``](Tutorial_Models.md#Atmospheric-Model). If none is given, ``"corsika"`` is used. This parameter is case-insensitive.
* **``location``:** The name of the location for which to calculate the surface fluxes, or the (latitude, longitude) coordinates of the location. See the options in [``Tutorial_Models``](Tutorial_Models.md#Atmospheric-Model). If none is given, ``"USStd"`` is used. This parameter is case-sensitive.
* **``month``:** The month for which to calculate the surface fluxes. See the options in [``Tutorial_Models``](Tutorial_Models.md#Atmospheric-Model). This parameter can only be used in conjunction with ``atmosphere = "msis00"``, otherwise it is ``None``. This parameter is case-sensitive.

Multiple options are available to calculate underground intensities: different combinations of tensors can be provided from which to calculate the intensities, or different combinations of models can be provided. To calculate underground intensities using the ZatsepinSokolskaya primary model, for example, one can do:

```python
u_fluxes = mtu.calc_u_fluxes(primary_model = "zs")

mtu.calc_u_intensities(method = "sd", u_fluxes = u_fluxes)
```

This is equivalent to:

```python
s_fluxes = mts.calc_s_fluxes(primary_model = "zs")

mtu.calc_u_intensities(method = "sd", s_fluxes = s_fluxes)
```

This is equivalent to:

```python
mtu.calc_u_intensities(method = "sd", model = "mceq", primary_model = "zs")
```

This is equivalent to:

```python
mtu.calc_u_intensities(method = "sd", model = "mceq", primary_model = (pm.ZatsepinSokolskaya, "default"))
```

In the last call above, ``pm`` is the [``crflux.models``](https://github.com/mceq-project/crflux) package. Which is the most appropriate or efficient depends on the specific use case. For more information on changing the models, see [``Tutorial_Models``](Tutorial_Models.md), and for an example of how to set different primary models, see [``/examples/example_primary_flux_models.ipynb``](../examples/example_primary_flux_models.ipynb)

The arguments are listed above in their order of precedence. For example, if both ``u_fluxes`` and ``s_fluxes`` are provided, only ``u_fluxes`` will be used, because it is higher in the list than ``s_fluxes``. As a rule of thumb for the sake of efficiency, MUTE tries to perform as few calculations as possible.

If no underground flux tensor is provided, the surface flux matrix and survival probability tensor are used to calculate one. If no surface flux matrix is provided, the function calls ``mts.load_s_fluxes_from_file()``, which searches for a surface flux file that has a name matching the set models and atmosphere. If no survival probability tensor is provided, the function calls ``mtp.load_survival_probability_tensor_from_file()``, which searches for a survival probability file that has a name matching the set global parameters. If it finds the required files, it will load the surface fluxes and / or survival probabilities from those files. If it does not, it will try to calculate new surface fluxes and / or survival probabilities.

#### Specifying Angles

The function call above will return an array of underground muon intensities for the 28 default angles (or otherwise, depending on the value set for the vertical depth; see [above](#flat-overburdens)). The angles can be changed by passing angles in degrees (float or array-like) into the function. To return the underground intensities for 100 angles between 20 and 85 degrees, for example, one can do:

```python
angles = np.linspace(20, 85, 100)

mtu.calc_u_intensities(method = "sd", angles = angles)
```

The function will interpolate over the default energy and angle grids to get the underground intensities at these angles. For this reason, it is not advised to pass in an array that is finer grained than ``mtc.angles``, though it is possible.

### Vertical-Equivalent Underground Intensities

Vertical-equivalent underground intensities are those defined by the following equation:

$$I^u_{\mathrm{eq}}(\theta)=I^u(\theta)\cos(\theta),$$

where $I^u_{\mathrm{eq}}(\theta)$ is the vertical-equivalent underground intensity, and $I^u(\theta)$ is the single-differential underground intensity, described [above](#single-differential-underground-intensities).

#### Calling the Function

The function is called identically to that for single-differential underground intensities (see [above](#single-differential-underground-intensities)). The same keyword arguments are accepted, and angles are specified in the same way. The only difference is that ``method`` must be ``"eq"`` instead of ``"sd"``. Running the line below will use the defaults for all of the arguments:

```python
mtu.calc_u_intensities(method = "eq", output = None, file_name = "", force = False, u_fluxes = None, s_fluxes = None, survival_probability_tensor = None, angles = mtc.angles, E_th = 0, model = "mceq", return_error = False, primary_model = "gsf", interaction_model = "sibyll23c", atmosphere = "corsika", location = "USStd", month = None)
```

This returns a one-dimensional array of length ``len(angles)``. The underground intensities in the array will have units of $(\mathrm{cm}^2\ \mathrm{s}\ \mathrm{sr})^{-1}$.

For an example, see [``/examples/example_vertical_intensities.ipynb``](../examples/example_vertical_intensities.ipynb).

### True Vertical Underground Intensities

True vertical underground intensities are those defined by the following equation:

$$I^u_{\mathrm{tr}}(X)=\int_{E_{\mathrm{th}}}^{\infty}\mathrm{d}E^u\Phi^u(E^u, X, \theta=0),$$

where $I^u_{\mathrm{tr}}$ is the true vertical underground intensity.

#### Calling the Function

The function is called similarly to that for single-differential underground intensities (see [above](#single-differential-underground-intensities)). The main differences are that ``method`` must be ``"tr"`` instead of ``"sd"``, and that the function takes an optional ``depths`` argument, which takes its default values from ``mtc.slant_depths``, instead of an ``angles`` argument. Running the line below will use the defaults for all of the arguments:

```python
mtu.calc_u_intensities(method = "tr", output = None, file_name = "", force = False, u_fluxes = None, s_fluxes = None, survival_probability_tensor = None, depths = mtc.slant_depths, E_th = 0, model = "mceq", return_error = False, primary_model = "gsf", interaction_model = "sibyll23c", atmosphere = "corsika", location = "USStd", month = None)
```

This returns a one-dimensional array of length ``len(depths)``. The underground intensities in the array will have units of $(\mathrm{cm}^2\ \mathrm{s}\ \mathrm{sr})^{-1}$.

For an example, see [``/examples/example_vertical_intensities.ipynb``](../examples/example_vertical_intensities.ipynb).

The slant depths can be changed by passing slant depths in km.w.e. (float or array-like) into the function. To return the true vertical underground intensities for 40 slant depths between 3 and 10 km.w.e., for example, one can do:

```python
depths = np.linspace(3, 10, 40)

mtu.calc_u_intensities(method = "tr", depths = depths)
```

The function will interpolate over the default energy and angle grids to get the true vertical underground intensities at these depths. For this reason, it is not advised to pass in an array that is finer grained than ``mtc.depths``, though it is possible.

### Double-Differential Underground Intensities

Double-differential underground intensities are those defined by the following equation:

$$I^u_{\mathrm{dd}}(X(\theta, \phi), \theta)=\int_{E_{\mathrm{th}}}^{\infty}\mathrm{d}E^u\Phi^u(E^u, X, \theta),$$

where $I^u_{\mathrm{dd}}(X(\theta, \phi), \theta)$ is the double-differential underground intensity, and $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle.

#### Calling the Function

The function is called similarly to that for single-differential underground intensities (see [above](#single-differential-underground-intensities)). The main differences are that ``method`` must be ``"dd"`` instead of ``"sd"``, and that the function takes neither an ``angles`` argument nor a ``depths`` argument. Additionally, this function can only be used when the overburden type is set to ``"mountain"``. Running the line below will use the defaults for all of the arguments:

```python
mtu.calc_u_intensities(method = "dd", output = None, file_name = "", force = False, u_fluxes = None, s_fluxes = None, survival_probability_tensor = None, E_th = 0, model = "mceq", return_error = False, primary_model = "gsf", interaction_model = "sibyll23c", atmosphere = "corsika", location = "USStd", month = None)
```

This returns a two-dimensional array of shape ``(len(mtc.mountain.zenith), len(mtc.mountain.azimuthal))``. The underground intensities in the array will have units of $(\mathrm{cm}^2\ \mathrm{s}\ \mathrm{sr}\ \mathrm{km.w.e.})^{-1}$.

## Calculating Underground Fluxes

Underground fluxes in MUTE are calculated by convolving the results from daemonflux or MCEq for the surface flux with the results from PROPOSAL for the survival probabilities:

$$\Phi^u(E^u, X, \theta)=\sum_{E^s}\Phi^s(E^s, \theta)P(E^s, E^u, X)\left(\frac{\Delta E^s}{\Delta E^u}\right),$$

where $\Phi^u(E^u, X, \theta)$ is the underground flux, $\Phi^s(E^s, \theta)$ is the surface flux, $P(E^s, E^u, X)$ is the survival probability tensor, and $\Delta E^s$ and $\Delta E^u$ are the energy bin widths for the surface and underground energies respectively.

Underground fluxes can be calculated using the ``mtu.calc_u_fluxes()`` function. Its arguments are similar to those for ``mtu.calc_u_intensities()`` (see [above](#single-differential-underground-intensities)), with some differences. There are no ``method``, ``u_fluxes``, or ``E_th`` arguments for this function. Additionally, it can take a ``full_tensor`` argument. Running the line below will use the defaults for all of the arguments:

```python
mtu.calc_u_fluxes(s_fluxes = None, survival_probability_tensor = None, full_tensor = False, model = "mceq", return_error = False, primary_model = "gsf", interaction_model = "sibyll23c", atmosphere = "corsika", location = "USStd", month = None, output = None, file_name = "", force = False)
```

For a flat overburden, this function will return a two-dimensional array of shape ``(91, 28)``, where the zeroth axis is the underground energies, and the first axis is the zenith angles. The units of the underground fluxes will be $(\mathrm{cm}^2\ \mathrm{s}\ \mathrm{sr}\ \mathrm{MeV})^{-1}$. If the argument ``full_tensor`` is set to ``True``, the full three-dimensional array will be returned, rather than a two-dimensional array, as it is for the case of a mountain.

For a mountain, this function will return a three-dimensional array of shape ``(28, 91, 20)``, where the zeroth axis is the slant depths, the first axis is the underground energies, and the second axis is the zenith angles (from ``mtc.ANGLES_FOR_S_FLUXES``). The units of the underground fluxes will be $(\mathrm{cm}^2\ \mathrm{s}\ \mathrm{sr}\ \mathrm{MeV}^2)^{-1}$.

For an example, see [``/examples/example_underground_flux.ipynb``](../examples/example_underground_flux.ipynb).

## Calculating Underground Angular Distributions

Underground angular distributions are calculated by integrating the underground intensities over either the azimuthal angles, for the zenith angular distribution, or the zenith angle, for the azimuthal angular distribution. For the zenith angular distribution:

$$\Phi_{\phi}^{u}(\theta)=\int_{\phi_{\mathrm{min}}}^{\phi_{\mathrm{max}}}\mathrm{d}\phi I^u_{\mathrm{dd}}(X(\theta, \phi), \theta),$$

where $\Phi_{\phi}^{u}(\theta)$ is the underground zenith angular distribution, and $\phi_{\mathrm{min}}$ and $\phi_{\mathrm{max}}$ are, respectively, the minimum and maximum azimuthal angles from the mountain profile file. Note that the subscript on $\Phi^u$ denotes the variable being integrated over. For the azimuthal angular distribution:

$$\Phi_{\theta}^{u}(\phi)=\int_{c_{\mathrm{min}}}^{c_{\mathrm{max}}}\mathrm{d}\cos(\theta) I^u_{\mathrm{dd}}(X(\theta, \phi), \theta),$$

where $\Phi_{\theta}^{u}(\phi)$ is the underground azimuthal angular distribution, and $c_{\mathrm{min}}$ and $c_{\mathrm{max}}$ are, respectively, the cosines of the minimum and maximum zenith angles given in the mountain profile file.

Underground angular distributions can be calculated using the ``mtu.calc_u_ang_dist()`` function. Its arguments are similar to those for ``mtu.calc_u_intensities()`` (see [above](#single-differential-underground-intensities)), with some differences. There is no ``method`` argument for this function, though there is a required ``kind`` argument, to specify either ``"zenith"`` (for the zenith angular distribution) or ``"azimuthal"`` (for the azimuthal angular distribution). Running the line below will use the defaults for all of the arguments:

```python
mtu.calc_u_ang_dist(kind, output = None, file_name = "", force = False, s_fluxes = None, survival_probability_tensor = None, E_th = 0, model = "mceq", return_error = False, primary_model = "gsf", interaction_model = "sibyll23c", atmosphere = "corsika", location = "USStd", month = None)
```

This function returns an array of length ``len(mtc.mountain.zenith)`` in units of $(\mathrm{cm}^2\ \mathrm{s})^{-1}$ for a zenith angular distribution, or of length ``len(mtc.mountain.azimuthal)`` in units of $(\mathrm{cm}^2\ \mathrm{s}\ \mathrm{rad})^{-1}$ for an azimuthal angular distribution.

For an example, see [``/examples/example_angular_distribution.ipynb``](../examples/example_angular_distribution.ipynb).

## Calculating Underground Energy Spectra

Underground energy spectra are calculated by integrating the underground fluxes over the solid angle. For a flat overburden, symmetry is assumed for the azimuthal angle. Integration over the azimuthal angle, therefore, gives a factor of $2\pi$. The calculation, then, only deals with the integration over the zenith angle:

$$\Phi_{\Omega}^{u}(E^u)=2\pi\int_0^{c_{\mathrm{max}}}\mathrm{d}\cos(\theta)\Phi^u(E^u, X(\theta, \phi), \theta),$$

where $\Phi_{\Omega}^{u}$ is the underground energy spectrum, and $c_{\mathrm{max}}$ is the cosine of the maximum zenith angle from ``angles``.

For mountains, the azimuthal angles are taken from the mountain profile file. Therefore, the integration is done over both angles in the calculation:

$$\Phi_{\Omega}^{u}(E^u)=\int_{\phi_{\mathrm{min}}}^{\phi_{\mathrm{max}}}\int_{c_{\mathrm{min}}}^{c_{\mathrm{max}}}\mathrm{d}\cos(\theta)\mathrm{d}\phi\Phi^u(E^u, X(\theta, \phi), \theta),$$

where $\phi_{\mathrm{min}}$, $\phi_{\mathrm{max}}$, $c_{\mathrm{min}}$, and $c_{\mathrm{max}}$ are, respectively, the minimum and maximum azimuthal and cosine of the zenith angles given in the mountain profile file.

Underground energy spectra can be calculated using the ``mtu.calc_u_e_spect()`` function. Its arguments are similar to those for ``mtu.calc_u_intensities()`` (see [above](#single-differential-underground-intensities)), with some differences. There is no ``method`` argument for this function. Running the line below will use the defaults for all of the arguments:

```python
mtu.calc_u_e_spect(output = None, file_name = "", force = False, s_fluxes = None, survival_probability_tensor = None, E_th = 0, model = "mceq", return_error = False, primary_model = "gsf", interaction_model = "sibyll23c", atmosphere = "corsika", location = "USStd", month = None)
```

For both flat overburdens and mountains, this function returns an array of length ``91`` in units of $(\mathrm{cm}^2\ \mathrm{s}\ \mathrm{MeV})^{-1}$.

For an example, see [``/examples/example_energy.ipynb``](../examples/example_energy.ipynb).

## Calculating Mean and Median Underground Energies

Mean underground energies are given by the first raw moment of the underground muon energy spectrum (see [above](#calculating-underground-energy-spectra)):

$$\langle E^u\rangle=\frac{\int^{\infty}\_{E_{\mathrm{th}}}\mathrm{d}E^uE^u\Phi^u_{\Omega}(E^u)}{\int^{\infty}\_{E_{\mathrm{th}}}\mathrm{d}E^u\Phi^u_{\Omega}(E^u)},$$

where $\left<E^u\right>$ is the mean underground energy, $\Phi^u_{\Omega}(E^u)$ is the underground energy spectrum, and $E_\mathrm{th}$ is an energy threshold.

Mean underground energies can be calculated for a given overburden, either flat or mountain, using the ``mtu.calc_u_mean_e()`` function. Its arguments are similar to those for ``mtu.calc_u_intensities()`` (see [above](#single-differential-underground-intensities)). Running the line below will use the defaults for all of the arguments:

```python
mtu.calc_u_mean_e(force = False, u_fluxes = None, s_fluxes = None, survival_probability_tensor = None, E_th = 0, model = "mceq", return_error = False, primary_model = "gsf", interaction_model = "sibyll23c", atmosphere = "corsika", location = "USStd", month = None)
```

For both flat overburdens and mountains, this function returns an array of six numbers, each with units of MeV. These six numbers are, in order:

1. The mean underground energy.
2. The median underground energy.
3. The positive 68% confidence interval on the median underground energy.
4. The negative 68% confidence interval on the median underground energy.
5. The positive 95% confidence interval on the median underground energy.
6. The negative 95% confidence interval on the median underground energy.

For an example, see [``/examples/example_energy.ipynb``](../examples/example_energy.ipynb).

## Calculating Total Underground Fluxes

Total underground fluxes are calculated by integrating the underground intensities over the angles. For a flat overburden, symmetry is assumed for the azimuthal angle. Integration over the azimuthal angle, therefore, gives a factor of $2\pi$. The calculation, then, only deals with the integration over the zenith angle:

$$\Phi_{\mathrm{tot}}^{u}=2\pi\int_0^{c_{\mathrm{max}}}\mathrm{d}\cos(\theta)I^u(\theta),$$

where $\Phi_{\mathrm{tot}}^{u}$ is the total underground flux, and $c_{\mathrm{max}}$ is the cosine of the maximum zenith angle from ``angles``.

For mountains, the azimuthal angles are taken from the mountain profile file. Therefore, the integration is done over both angles in the calculation:

$$\Phi_{\mathrm{tot}}^{u}=\int_{\phi_{\mathrm{min}}}^{\phi_{\mathrm{max}}}\int_{c_{\mathrm{min}}}^{c_{\mathrm{max}}}\mathrm{d}\cos(\theta)\mathrm{d}\phi I^u_{\mathrm{dd}}(X(\theta, \phi), \theta),$$

where $\phi_{\mathrm{min}}$, $\phi_{\mathrm{max}}$, $c_{\mathrm{min}}$, and $c_{\mathrm{max}}$ are, respectively, the minimum and maximum azimuthal and cosine of the zenith angles given in the mountain profile file.

Total underground fluxes can be calculated using the ``mtu.calc_u_tot_flux()`` function. Its arguments are similar to those for ``mtu.calc_u_intensities()`` (see [above](#single-differential-underground-intensities)), with some differences. There is no ``method`` argument for this function (for flat overburdens, it will use ``method = "sd"`` to calculate underground intensities, and, for mountains, it will use ``method = "dd"``). Additionally, it can take an ``angles`` argument, but not a ``depths`` argument. Lastly, there are no ``output`` or ``file_name`` arguments, as the output is a single number in every case. Running the line below will use the defaults for all of the arguments:

```python
mtu.calc_u_tot_flux(force = False, s_fluxes = None, survival_probability_tensor = None, angles = mtc.angles, E_th = 0, model = "mceq", return_error = False, primary_model = "gsf", interaction_model = "sibyll23c", atmosphere = "corsika", location = "USStd", month = None)
```

For both flat overburdens and mountains, this function returns a single number (a float) in units of $(\mathrm{cm}^2\ \mathrm{s})^{-1}$.

For an example, see [``/examples/total_flux_plot.ipynb``](../examples/example_total_flux_plot.ipynb).

## Calculating Underground Depths

As of [v3.0.0](https://github.com/wjwoodley/mute/releases/tag/3.0.0), in addition to calculating physics observables related to the underground muon spectrum, MUTE also provides a function to calculate various types of depths. This can be done using the ``mtu.calc_depth()`` function. Because the depth is set by the user for flat overburdens, using the ``mtc.set_vertical_depth()`` function, and is therefore trivial, ``mtu.calc_depth()`` is only available for mountain overburdens.

Running the line below will use the defaults for all of the arguments:

```python
mtu.calc_depth(kind, u_tot_flux = None, force = False, u_fluxes = None, s_fluxes = None, survival_probability_tensor = None, E_th = 0, model = "mceq", return_error = False, primary_model = "gsf", interaction_model = "sibyll23c", atmosphere = "corsika", location = "USStd", month = None)
```

The ``kind`` argument is required to define the kind of depth MUTE should calculate. The possible options are:

* **``ev``:** The equivalent vertical depth obtained by fitting the input or calculated total flux to a total flux curve for standard rock (see https://inspirehep.net/literature/2799258 for more details on equivalent vertical depths).
* **``v``:** The straight vertical depth (engineering depth) at the center of the mountain profile (see https://inspirehep.net/literature/2799258 for more details on the engineering depth).
* **``min``:** The minimum depth in the mountain profile file.
* **``max``:** The maximum depth in the mountain profile file.
* **``avg``:** The average depth in the mountain profile file.
* **``mean``:** An alias for ``avg``.

When this function is run, MUTE internally calculates an array of total flux values at various depths under standard rock, and constructs a flux vs depth curve out of them (like the one plotted [above](#short-example)). It then takes the total underground flux value input into the ``u_tot_flux`` argument, or calculates one using the default models if one is not provided, lets it float along the depth axis, fits it to the flux vs depth curve, and determines the depth for which it lands on the curve. In this way, it returns specifically a standard-rock equivalent vertical depth.

In order to fit to a different flux vs depth curve (for a medium other than standard rock, for example), the function also accepts a ``survival_probability_tensor`` argument. A survival probability tensor can be loaded in using the ``mtp.load_survival_probability_tensor_from_file()`` function (see [below](#calculating-survival-probabilities)), which can then passed into the ``mtu.calc_depth()`` function through this argument.

This function returns a single number (a float) in units of km.w.e.

For an example of this function being used, see [``/examples/total_flux_plot.ipynb``](../examples/example_total_flux_plot.ipynb).

## Calculating Surface Quantities

### Surface Fluxes

Surface flux matrices can be calculated using the ``mts.calc_s_fluxes()`` function, which makes use of [daemonflux](https://github.com/mceq-project/daemonflux) or [MCEq](https://github.com/afedynitch/MCEq). Its arguments are similar to those for ``mtu.calc_u_fluxes()`` (see [above](#calculating-underground-fluxes)), with the only differences being the absence of the ``s_fluxes`` and ``full_tensor`` arguments. Running the line below will use the defaults for all of the arguments:

```python
mts.calc_s_fluxes(model = "mceq", return_error = False, primary_model = "gsf", interaction_model = "sibyll23c", atmosphere = "corsika", location = "USStd", month = None, output = None, file_name = "", force = False, test = False)
```

This returns a two-dimensional array of shape ``(91, 20)``, where the zeroth axis is the surface energies, and the first axis is the zenith angles (from ``mtc.ANGLES_FOR_S_FLUXES``). The surface energy grid used throughout MUTE (``mtc.ENERGIES``) is the energy grid provided by MCEq, but with energies beyond 100 PeV cut, as the surface flux for energies higher than this is negligible for depths up to 14 km.w.e.

To calculate surface fluxes using the HillasGaisser2012 primary flux model for Gran Sasso in January, for example, one can do:

```python
mts.calc_s_fluxes(model = "mceq", primary_model = "h3a", atmosphere = "msis00", location = "SanGrasso", month = "January")
```

After a surface flux matrix has been calculated, it can be passed into other functions with the ``s_fluxes`` argument. Additionally, if an output file was produced, the matrix can be read back in from this output file using the ``mts.load_s_fluxes_from_file()`` function. This function can take either a file name, or the same arguments as ``mts.calc_s_fluxes()`` to define the models. To load the output file produced by the line of code just above, for example, one can do:

```python
mts.load_s_fluxes_from_file(model = "mceq", primary_model = "h3a", atmosphere = "msis00", location = "SanGrasso", month = "January")
```

Note that the ``model``, ``primary_model``, ``interaction_model``, and ``atmosphere`` parameters are case-insensitive, while the ``location`` and ``month`` parameters are case-sensitive.

### Surface Intensities

Surface intensities are single-differential intensities calculated by integrating the surface fluxes over the surface energies:

$$I^s(\theta)=\int^{\infty}_0\mathrm{d}E^s\Phi^s(E^s, \theta),$$

where $I^s(\theta)$ is the surface intensity, $E^s$ is the surface energy, and $\Phi^s(E^s, \theta)$ is the surface flux.

Surface intensities can be calculated using the ``mts.calc_s_intensities()`` function. Its arguments are similar to ``mts.calc_s_fluxes()`` (see [above](#surface-fluxes)), with the addition of an ``s_fluxes`` argument to pass a surface flux matrix into the function. Running the line below will use the defaults for all of the arguments:

```python
mts.calc_s_intensities(s_fluxes = None, model = "mceq", return_error = False, primary_model = "gsf", interaction_model = "sibyll23c", atmosphere = "corsika", location = "USStd", month = None, output = None, file_name = "", force = False)
```

This returns a one-dimensional array of length ``20`` (from ``mtc.ANGLES_FOR_S_FLUXES``). The surface intensities in the array will have units $(\mathrm{cm}^2\ \mathrm{s}\ \mathrm{sr})^{-1}$.

### Surface Energy Spectra

Surface energy spectra are calculated by integrating the suface fluxes over the solid angle. Symmetry is assumed for the azimuthal angle, and so integration over the azimuthal angle gives a factor of $2\pi$. The calculation, then, only deals with the integration over the zenith angle:

$$\Phi_{\Omega}^{s}(E^u)=2\pi\int_0^{c_{\mathrm{max}}}\mathrm{d}\cos(\theta)\Phi^s(E^s, \theta),$$

where $\Phi_{\Omega}^{s}$ is the surface energy spectrum, and $c_{\mathrm{max}}$ is the cosine of the maximum zenith angle from ``angles``.

Surface energy spectra can be calculated using the ``mts.calc_s_e_spect()`` function. Its arguments are very similar to those for ``mts.calc_s_fluxes()``. Running the line below will use the defaults for all of the arguments:

```python
mts.calc_s_e_spect(output = None, file_name = "", force = False, s_fluxes = None, model = "mceq", return_error = False, primary_model = "gsf", interaction_model = "sibyll23c", atmosphere = "corsika", location = "USStd", month = None)
```

This function returns an array of length ``91`` in units of $(\mathrm{cm}^2\ \mathrm{s}\ \mathrm{MeV})^{-1}$.

### Total Surface Fluxes

Total surface fluxes are calculated by integrating the surface intensities over the angles. At the surface, symmetry is assumed for the azimuthal angle. Integration over the azimuthal angle, therefore, gives a factor of $2\pi$. The calculation, then, only deals with the integration over the zenith angle:

$$\Phi_{\mathrm{tot}}^{s}=2\pi\int_0^1\mathrm{d}\cos(\theta)I^s(\theta),$$

where $\Phi_{\mathrm{tot}}^{s}$ is the total surface flux.

Total surface fluxes can be calculated using the ``mts.calc_s_tot_flux()`` function. Its arguments are similar to those for ``mts.calc_s_intensities()`` (see [above](#surface-intensities)), with the only difference being the absence of the ``output`` and ``file_name`` arguments. Running the line below will use the defaults for all of the arguments:

```python
mts.calc_s_tot_fluxes(s_fluxes = None, model = "mceq", return_error = False, primary_model = "gsf", interaction_model = "sibyll23c", atmosphere = "corsika", location = "USStd", month = None, force = False)
```

This returns a single number (a float) in units of $(\mathrm{cm}^2\ \mathrm{s})^{-1}$.

## Calculating Survival Probabilities

The main functions in ``mute.propagation`` used for the propagation of muons through matter and the calculation of survival probability tensors are:

1. ``mtp.propagate_muons(seed = 0, job_array_number = 0, output = None, force = False)``
2. ``mtp.calc_survival_probability_tensor(seed = 0, file_name_pattern = None, n_job = 1, output = None, file_name = "", force = False)``

For general purposes, the second function can be used. It will check if underground (or underwater, etc.) muon energies for the set global propagation constants have been specified or already exist. If they do, it will load them and calculate survival probabilities. If they do not, it will call ``mtp.propagate_muons()``, which begins the Monte Carlo simulation using <a href="https://github.com/tudo-astroparticlephysics/PROPOSAL" target="_blank">PROPOSAL</a>.

The ``mtp.calc_survival_probability_tensor()`` function will return a three-dimensional array of shape ``(91, 28, 91)``, where the zeroth axis is the surface energies, the first axis is the slant depths, and the second axis is the underground energies. The units of the survival probabilities will be $(\mathrm{MeV}^2\ \mathrm{km.w.e.})^{-1}$.

After a survival probability tensor has been calculated, it can be passed into other functions with the ``survival_probability_tensor`` argument. Additionally, if an output file was produced, the tensor can be read back in from this output file using the ``mtp.load_survival_probability_tensor_from_file()`` function. This function can take an optional file name from which to load the survival probabilities:

```python
mtp.load_survival_probability_tensor_from_file(file_name = "", force = False)
```

If no file name is given, one is constructed based on the set global propagation constants.

For an example, see [``/examples/example_load_survival_probability_tensor.ipynb``](../examples/example_load_survival_probability_tensor.ipynb).
